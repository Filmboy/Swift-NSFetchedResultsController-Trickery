# Swift NSFetchedResultsController Trickery

This is the full source code for a demo app accompanying the [Swift NSFetchedResultsController Trickery](http://www.iosnomad.com/blog/2014/8/6/swift-nsfetchedresultscontroller-trickery) blogpost on [iOS Nomad](http://www.iosnomad.com). It is used to demonstrate the following techniques:

* Using a meta data entity for fetching
* Arbitrary section ordering
* Animating between different grouping of data
* Semantic drag 'n' drop
* Showing empty sections through a proxy

Feel free to show smarter ways of accomplishing this in Swift by sending in pull requests :)
